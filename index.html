        <p>
          After working in Human Resources for 10 years I discoverd the tech world and am loving it.  Currently I work as 
          a Dev Ops Manager at a 3PL where we have developed and maintain our own Warehouse Management System software.  
          In that role I Manage a team responsible for answering customer IT tickets and helping to coordinate fixes and improvements to our WMS called BlueBox.
          My quest for continued knowledge currently lies in completing a full stack development bootcamp.
